<p>Hi, I'm Ishan.</p>
<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student at Berkeley AI Research, advised by <a href="http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com/">Jennifer Listgarten</a>. I work on generative models and agents for scientific discovery.</p>
<p>I spent part of my gap year at <a href="https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/aviv-regev">Aviv Regev</a>'s group at Genentech, working on multimodal language models with the wonderful <a href="https://x.com/LeeTaliq">Yongju Lee</a>. Before that, I graduated from Stanford with bachelors and masters degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. During my time there, I was fortunate to have worked with <a href="https://lundberglab.stanford.edu/">Emma Lundberg</a> on vision models for maping dynamic changes in the human proteome. I also worked on applications of novel hardware accelerators for machine learning, advised by <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/oyekunle-olukotun">Kunle Olukotun</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/mshahbaz/mshahbaz.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home">Muhammad Shahbaz</a>.</p>
