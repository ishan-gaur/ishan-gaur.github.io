<p>While the primary sequences of human proteins have been cataloged for over a decade, determining how these are organized into a dynamic collection of multiprotein assemblies, with structures and functions spanning biological scales, is an ongoing venture. Systematic and data-driven analyses of these higher-order structures are emerging, facilitating the discovery and understanding of cellular phenotypes. At present, knowledge of protein localization and function has been primarily derived from manual annotation and curation in resources such as the Gene Ontology, which are biased toward richly annotated genes in the literature. Here, we envision a future powered by data-driven mapping of protein assemblies. These maps can capture and decode cellular functions through the integration of protein expression, localization, and interaction data across length scales and timescales. In this review, we focus on progress toward constructing integrated cell maps that accelerate the life sciences and translational research.</p>
